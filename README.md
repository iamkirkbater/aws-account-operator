# AWS Account Operator

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/aws-account-operator/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/aws-account-operator)

## General Overview

The operator is responsible for creating and maintaining a pool of AWS accounts and assigning accounts to AccountClaims. The operator creates the account in AWS, does initial setup and configuration of the those accounts, creates IAM resources and expose credentials for a IAM user with enough permissions to provision an OpenShift 4.x cluster.

The operator is deployed to an OpenShift cluster in the `aws-account-operator` namespace.

## Quick Start

This Quick Start assumes that you are working on a team that already has AWS Accounts set up for development/testing.  For first time setup, see the prerequisites documentation page.

First, set up your required environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=
export FORCE_DEV_MODE=local
export OSD_STAGING_1_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=
export OSD_STAGING_2_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=
export OSD_STAGING_1_OU_ROOT_ID=
export OSD_STAGING_1_OU_BASE_ID=
```

[direnv](https://direnv.net) is what some team members use, and you can add the above block (with variables filled in) into a `.envrc` file (make sure `.envrc` is in your global git ignore as well) and upon entry to the `aws-account-operator` folder the env vars inside the file will be loaded automatically, and unset when you leave the folder.

Next, get your AWS Credentials for the payer account you will be using and export the access key and secret using the following environment variables:

```txt
OPERATOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
OPERATOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

These only need to be set the first time you deploy the operator locally.  Then, run `make predeploy`.

Then, you should be able to run `operator-sdk run --local --namespace aws-account-operator`, and you're up and running.

## Testing

To test that everything's working correctly, we have a set of "acceptance" tests that we've compiled into a single make target:

```shell
make test-all
```

If the everything is set up correctly this should verify that.
